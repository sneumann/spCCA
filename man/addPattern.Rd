\title{cluster weight vectors by assigning them to one pattern
The addPattern function clusters weight vectors by assigning them to one pattern 
in the given list. It checks if the mean cluster vector is similar to a new z.vector, 
and makes a new cluster if not similar to any existing cluster, 
counts the number of vectors associated with one cluster, 
and saves the correlation for the cluster. 
The function returns the updated list of patterns.}
\usage{
addPattern(List.Pattern, corr, xyz.vector, z.vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{List.Pattern}{The list of existing patterns.}

\item{corr}{(STN: LLM says:) The correlation value.}

\item{xyz.vector}{(STN: LLM says:) The combined vector of x, y, and z-weight.}

\item{z.vector}{The vector for comparison to find or create clusters}
}
\value{
List of cluster items:
  item [[1]]: correlation
  item [[2]]: combined vector of x, y, and z-weight
  item [[3]]: counter for number of vectors in cluster
}
\description{
The addPattern function is called within the get.best.lambdas
}
